CHANGES for tw-priority-hook
=============================

v0.1.0 - 2026-01-17
-------------------
Initial implementation:
- Created directory structure matching recurrence project
- need.rc with UDA definition and auto-assignment rules
- need.rc initializes context.need.read with default filter
- Command alias: task need → runs need.py report
- on-add_priority.py hook for automatic priority assignment
- on-modify_priority.py hook to enforce priority requirement
- on-exit_priority.py hook to update context on completion/deletion
- All hooks automatically maintain context.need.read in need.rc
- Context filter includes lookback constraint to exclude old overdue tasks
- need.py companion script for status report and span adjustment
- Uses native 'task context need' and 'task context none' commands
- Migration script (migrate_priority.py) to convert H/M/L to 1-6 scale
