- need.rc with UDA definition and auto-assignment rules
- need.rc initializes context.need.read with default filter
- Command alias: task need → runs need.py report
- on-add_priority.py hook for automatic priority assignment
- on-modify_priority.py hook to enforce priority requirement
- on-exit_priority.py hook to update context on completion/deletion
- All hooks automatically maintain context.need.read in need.rc
- Context filter includes lookback constraint to exclude old overdue tasks
- need.py companion script for status report and span adjustment
- Uses native 'task context need' and 'task context none' commands
- Migration script (migrate_priority.py) to convert H/M/L to 1-6 scale

CHANGES for tw-priority-hook
=============================

v0.2.0 - 2026-01-18
-------------------
Bug fixes:
- Fixed context not updating after task deletion
- on-modify now excludes the task being deleted/completed when calculating lowest priority
- Fixed task counts in need.py to ignore active context (shows all pending tasks)
- Fixed layout issues in need.py report (clean fixed-width columns)
- Added detailed logging to on-modify with status detection
- Added 'need update' command to manually recalculate context

Changes:
- Time format now user-specified (e.g., 2d, 1w, 3m) instead of converting
- Context renamed from 'need' to 'needs' (alias is 'need')
- Clarified that task delete triggers on-modify, not on-exit

v0.3.0 - 2026-01-18
-------------------
New features:
- Renamed need.py to nn.py (Needs Navigator) to avoid confusion with 'needs' context
- Added 'nn review' command for interactive priority assignment
  - Shows pyramid, then presents each task one-by-one
  - Review order: H/M/L tasks, no-priority tasks, then numeric (1-6)
  - Press 1-6 to assign priority, 'q' to quit
- Updated alias from 'task needs' to 'task nn'
